;; The system consists of two talkers, each with a feature-bus coming
;; in, and a comm-line connecting.
;; The state of this system can be described as a list of five elements:
;; (feat1 talker1 comm talker2 feat2)
;; Starting pattern for a instance
;; (  ((f1 1) (f2 2)) imap1  () imap2 () )
;;         or
;; (  ((f1 1) (f2 2)) imap 1 () imap2 ((f1 1) (f2 2)) )
;; Run a test by
;;   update imap1, update imap2: check for quiescence

;; A feature set is defined as follows:
;; There are five roles which can be expressed:
;; subject, object, action, instrument, place
;; Actions come from category " verb" and anywhere from 0-2 can be asserted
;; All others are nouns and 2-4 can be asserted
;; (YES, IT'S PRETTY ARBITRARY: I JUST WANT A DECENT-SIZED SPACE)
;; How big is it? 28 nouns, 7 verbs. avg 4 words/sentence.

;; talk returns: (imap comm)
;; prune-conflits returns: imap
;; listen returns: (imap feat)
;; iterate operates in the following manner:
;; 1. comm lines start blank.
;; 2. have everything speak
;; 3. have everything resolve speaking conflicts
;; 4. have everything listen
;; Unfortunately, if we do this in perfect order, then the synchrony
;; makes it difficult to separate the outgoing and incoming transmissions,
;; most particularly, to determine which bits of a feature are correct.
;; We solve this by ordering the transmissions such that one of the
;; two hears the others transmissions before its tramissions clutters
;; the wires. (If, of course, only one is transmitting, then it cannot
;; be pre-empted.)
